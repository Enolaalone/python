For the first time
scientists detected low-frequency
gravitational waves moving through the galaxy.
These cosmic ripples are likely the distant
echoes of supermassive black holes interacting and merging
many billions of light-years away. A consortium of international
researchers discovered
these cosmic waves by
measuring tiny time variations
in radio signals from pulsar stars.
The findings suggest that there were
ar more behemoth
black holes in the
early universe than
previously thought,
and continuing to
 study this new type of
gravitational wave
 could help unravel details
about the origins of
 our universe
and better explain
the unseen substances
and forces that
power the cosmos.
